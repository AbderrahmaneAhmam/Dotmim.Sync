- Add ScopeName as first paremeter in orchestrators methods
   this is good : await localOrchestrator.GetClientScopeAsync(scopeName, setup); 
   this seems bad:  await agent.SynchronizeAsync(this.Tables, scopeName);

- In creation of sp or table, we have

                if (scopeInfo.Schema == null)
                    return false;

Maybe, we should log something here ?
