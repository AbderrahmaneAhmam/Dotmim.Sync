- Add ScopeName as first paremeter in orchestrators methods
   this is good : await localOrchestrator.GetClientScopeAsync(scopeName, setup); 
   this seems bad:  await agent.SynchronizeAsync(this.Tables, scopeName);

- In creation of sp or table, we have

                if (scopeInfo.Schema == null)
                    return false;

Maybe, we should log something here ?


- agent.Parameters should come directly in SynchronizeAsync() arguments

- test DisableConstraintsAsync()

- Make all comments for public methods

- Check any public methods will not call any other public methods (because syncstage will change and we don't want that)

- In providers, make triggers creation UNION of all scopes columns

- New test : Create a client scope that does not exists, should return a correct error

- New test : Launch SynchronizeAsync(Tables) twice with different tables

- Check all behaviors from Sql Change Tracking are same now that Triggers are agnostic to columns. Check tests 

- Make tests on serializing / deserializing, especially with http (OnWritingRow, OnReadingRow)

- Check all InternalMethods have no default for connection, transaction, cancellationtoken, progress in arguments list

- Check All InternalMethods call are affecting the context instance (and no call are just " await Internal..." and more "(context, _) = await Internal...."   )

- Check all Internal methods are not public and are internal
